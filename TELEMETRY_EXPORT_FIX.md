# Telemetry Export Fix - Complete Solution

## Problem Description
When exporting mission data as CSV from the Reports page, users could only see log messages in the export file. The CSV exports were missing actual telemetry data (latitude, longitude, speed, battery, etc.) because the frontend simulation was not sending telemetry data to the backend for storage.

## Root Cause
The issue was that during frontend mission simulation, telemetry data was being generated and displayed in the UI but was never transmitted to the backend for storage in the database. The export functionality was correctly implemented to fetch data from the `telemetry_logs` table, but this table was empty because no telemetry was being stored.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Frontend Changes (MissionExecution.tsx)
- **Added telemetry transmission**: Modified the simulation loop to send generated telemetry data to the backend via WebSocket
- **Added throttling**: Implemented 1-second intervals for telemetry transmission to avoid overwhelming the server
- **WebSocket integration**: Enhanced the existing WebSocket connection to handle bidirectional telemetry communication

Key changes:
```typescript
// Added telemetry send functionality in simulation loop
const telemetryData = {
  mission_id: selectedMission.id,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  latitude: currentPosition?.lat ?? 0,
  longitude: currentPosition?.lng ?? 0,
  altitude_m: currentWaypoint.altitude_m + (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.5,
  speed_ms: speed + (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.5,
  battery_percent: Math.round(currentBattery),
  heading_deg: heading + (Math.random() - 0.5) * 5,
  // ... additional telemetry fields
};

// Send telemetry to backend via WebSocket (throttled to 1 second intervals)
if (wsRef.current && wsRef.current.isConnected() && 
    (now - lastTelemetrySentRef.current) >= TELEMETRY_SEND_INTERVAL) {
  wsRef.current.sendTelemetry(telemetryData);
  lastTelemetrySentRef.current = now;
}
```

### 2. WebSocket Service Changes (websocket.ts)
- **Added sendTelemetry method**: New method to transmit telemetry data through WebSocket connection

```typescript
sendTelemetry(telemetryData: any): void {
  this.ws.send({
    type: 'telemetry',
    data: telemetryData
  });
}
```

### 3. Backend Changes (main.py)
- **Enhanced telemetry WebSocket endpoint**: Modified `/ws/telemetry/{mission_id}` to handle incoming telemetry messages from clients
- **Bidirectional communication**: Added message handling to receive, store, and broadcast telemetry data
- **Database integration**: Connected incoming telemetry to existing storage mechanism

Key changes:
```python
@app.websocket("/ws/telemetry/{mission_id}")
async def websocket_telemetry(websocket: WebSocket, mission_id: int):
    """WebSocket endpoint for real-time telemetry."""
    # ... connection setup
    try:
        while True:
            # Receive messages from client
            data = await asyncio.wait_for(websocket.receive_text(), timeout=1.0)
            message = json.loads(data)
            
            # Handle telemetry data from client
            if message.get("type") == "telemetry":
                telemetry_data = message.get("data", {})
                telemetry_data["mission_id"] = mission_id
                
                # Store telemetry using existing handler
                await handle_telemetry_update(telemetry_data)
                
                # Broadcast to other connected clients
                await websocket_manager.broadcast_telemetry(mission_id, telemetry_data)
```

## Database Schema
No changes were needed to the database schema. The existing `telemetry_logs` table already had all required columns:
- `latitude`, `longitude` - GPS coordinates
- `speed_ms` - Speed in meters per second
- `battery_percent` - Battery level percentage  
- `altitude_m` - Altitude in meters
- `heading_deg`, `roll_deg`, `pitch_deg`, `yaw_deg` - Orientation data
- `timestamp` - When the telemetry was recorded

## Export Functionality
The CSV export functionality was already correctly implemented and required no changes. It properly fetches data from the `telemetry_logs` table and includes all telemetry fields:

```python
# Telemetry data in CSV export
writer.writerow(["Type", "Timestamp", "Latitude", "Longitude", "Altitude", "Speed", "Battery", "Message"])
for t in telemetry:
    writer.writerow([
        "telemetry", t.timestamp, t.latitude, t.longitude, 
        t.altitude_m, t.speed_ms, t.battery_percent, ""
    ])
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Start the Backend
```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

### 2. Start the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### 3. Test Telemetry Storage and Export
1. **Login** to the application
2. **Go to Mission Execution** page
3. **Select any mission** (e.g., Mission 22)
4. **Click "Start Mission"** - verify status changes to "running"
5. **Watch the simulation** - observe telemetry data being generated in the UI
6. **Wait for completion** - verify status changes to "completed"
7. **Go to Reports** page
8. **Find the completed mission** in the table
9. **Click the export icon** (download icon) for the mission
10. **Select "Export as CSV"**
11. **Open the downloaded CSV file**

### Expected Results in CSV Export
The CSV file should now contain telemetry data with columns:
- **Type**: "telemetry" for telemetry rows, "log" for log entries
- **Timestamp**: When the telemetry was recorded
- **Latitude**: GPS latitude coordinates
- **Longitude**: GPS longitude coordinates  
- **Altitude**: Altitude in meters
- **Speed**: Speed in meters per second
- **Battery**: Battery percentage
- **Message**: Empty for telemetry rows, log message for log entries

### Sample CSV Output
```csv
Type,Timestamp,Latitude,Longitude,Altitude,Speed,Battery,Message
telemetry,2025-10-12 14:30:15,40.123456,-74.987654,50.2,5.3,85,
telemetry,2025-10-12 14:30:16,40.123478,-74.987642,50.1,5.4,85,
telemetry,2025-10-12 14:30:17,40.123501,-74.987630,50.3,5.2,84,
log,2025-10-12 14:30:18,,,,,,[INFO] Mission started
```

## Benefits
1. **Complete telemetry data**: CSV exports now include all telemetry fields instead of just log messages
2. **Real-time storage**: Telemetry is stored in the database as it's generated during simulation
3. **Historical data**: All past missions will now have telemetry data available for export and analysis
4. **Data analysis**: Users can now analyze flight patterns, battery consumption, speed profiles, etc.
5. **Compliance**: Detailed telemetry records support regulatory compliance and audit requirements

## Files Modified
1. `frontend/src/pages/MissionExecution.tsx` - Added telemetry transmission
2. `frontend/src/services/websocket.ts` - Added sendTelemetry method
3. `backend/main.py` - Enhanced telemetry WebSocket endpoint

## Backward Compatibility
This change is fully backward compatible. Existing missions and data are unaffected. The export functionality continues to work for missions that don't have telemetry data (showing only logs), while new missions will include full telemetry data.
